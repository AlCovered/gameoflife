# "Life" :)

The game "Life" (eng. Conway's Game of Life) is a cellular automaton invented by the English mathematician John Conway in 1970.

Rules ->

- The scene of this game, the “universe,” is a surface or plane marked up into cells —   infinite, bounded, or closed (in the limit, an infinite plane).
In Our Game we have bounded scene.

- Each cell on this surface can be in two states: to be “alive” (filled) or to be “dead”   (empty). The cell has eight neighbors surrounding it.

- The distribution of living cells at the beginning of the game is called the first   generation. Each next generation is calculated based on the previous one according to the    following rules:
	- in an empty (dead) cell, next to which there are exactly three living cells, life 	  	  begins;
	- if a living cell has two or three living neighbors, then this cell continues to 	 	  live; otherwise, if there are less than two neighbors or more than three, the cell 	  dies ("from loneliness" or "from overpopulation")

- The game ends if:
	- on the field there will be no "live" cells
	- at the next step, none of the cells change their state

These simple rules lead to a huge variety of forms that can occur in the game.

The player does not directly participate in the game, but only arranges or generates the initial configuration of “living” cells, which then interact according to the rules without his participation (he is an observer).
